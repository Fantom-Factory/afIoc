
v1.7.0 Maybe...?
----------------
@Inject { optional = true }
 - i.e. if the service don't exist / not defined / don't inject it
 - why would you want to? And what of ctor args? 



Meh... can't be arsed
--------------------- 
Service disambiguation via facets 
 - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type & facet



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
Allow other @Inject facets
 - so BedSheet can define its own, for fewer pod import statements
 - but if afIoc and afBedSheet are imported at same time ~ conflict!

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById
 - now that serviceIds are qualified, what's the point?
 
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS
 - use placeholders instead

Create PerThreadService 
 - is just a registry.get()!

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
 
On RegistryShutdown
 - kill ALL ActorPools: 
   - No, lets users be in charge of their own pools.  
 - clean up ALL threads:
   - Can't! Can only clean up up current thread.
