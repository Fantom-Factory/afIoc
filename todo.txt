
v1.4.8 Maybe...?
-----------------

StartupOptions

Sometimes it's useful to pass const data into reg services - like BedSheetMetaData.
Might be nice to have some startup options available as an @Injectable service?


Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
ServiceIds should probably be fully qualified type names to avoid conflicts

TypeCoercers to be added via index props

Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 - it's messy and I don't need it
 - but then I could inject Loggers... Hmm...?

service disambiguation via facets 
 - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS
 - use placeholders instead

Create PerThreadService 
 - is just a registry.get()!

Registry.createProxy(mixinType, implType)
 - as impl type is not a service, it's quite useless.
 - better to enhance plastic

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
 
RegShutdown
 - kill the ConcurrentState actor pool 
   - can't, it's static. t'would affect ALL ConcurrentStates in other IoCs 
 - clean up ALL threads
   - can't, can only clean up up current thread

recursion err with builder methods injection scope 1->2->1
 - can't diagnose this, any reg.serviceById() creates a new InjectionCtx, so I can't detect recursion 
 - what people do in their builder methods is up to them!
