
v2.0.2 Maybe...?
----------------
make ServiceDefinitions.overrideByType more intelligent than type.qname

update aspects to wrap fields

Relocate RegistryStartup.printServiceList() and 
         RegistryStartup.printBanner() so they can be called externally! 


Meh... can't be arsed
--------------------- 
Make Service Advice orderable
 - just have MethodAdvisor.addAdvice return a Constraints impl

InjectionUtils 
 - tidy up the handling of default parameters

Service disambiguation via facets 
 - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type & facet

Make Js compatible...?
 - Phew! It's a biggie!



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
Allow other @Inject facets
 - so BedSheet can define its own, for fewer pod import statements
 - but if afIoc and afBedSheet are imported at same time ~ conflict!

Remove tracker info to improve performance
 - tried it.
 - deleted ALL tracker calls -> NO discernable speed difference!

Maybe add a means to delete / reset a service lifecycle?
 - people can create their own service lifecycle.
 - WHY!???
 - could fudge it with just a depProvider and autobuild!

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById
 - now that serviceIds are qualified, what's the point?
 
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS
 - use placeholders instead

Create PerThreadService 
 - is just a registry.get()!

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
 
On RegistryShutdown
 - kill ALL ActorPools: 
   - No, lets users be in charge of their own pools.  
 - clean up ALL threads:
   - Can't! Can only clean up up current thread.
