

v1.3.2 Maybe...?
---------------- 

thread manager - cleanup (kill thread services)

service disambiguation via facets - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet



Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 - it's messy and I don't need it

Move all tests out into a dedicated pod
 - v1.3 is 369 Kb!

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead

PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!

Registry.createProxy(mixinType, implType)
 - as impl type is not a service, it's quite useless.

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
