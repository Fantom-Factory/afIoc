
Not found Err - extend IocErr or not? have serviceById throw it

Adapter pattern


v1.3.2 Maybe...?
---------------- 

Mapped Overrides... shite. You can't change the KEY!

Optracker should not err.out but append to an OpTrackerErr (extend IocErr???)

@Advise to Err when no match...possible?
 - yeah, do check on reg startup
 - add 'optional' like with @controibute

recustion err with builder methods injection scope 1->2->1



Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 - it's messy and I don't need it

service disambiguation via facets 
 - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet

Move all tests out into a dedicated pod
 - v1.3 is 369 Kb!

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead

PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!

Registry.createProxy(mixinType, implType)
 - as impl type is not a service, it's quite useless.
 - better to enhance plastic

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
