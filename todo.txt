Service override service
contribution overrides - more than once? Order them?

proxies
methods only - or fields
 - don't override virtual or normal meths! Only abstract!
advice


OrderedConfig.addOrderedPlaceholder(Str placeholderName)

service disambiguation via facets - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet
@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - depPro ctx (a convienience for serviceById)




Bad ideas:
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. before: * NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead
PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!
