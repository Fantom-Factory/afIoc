proxies - How to turn them off? via bind AND build method

Registry.creeateProxy(mixin, impltype)

advice

service disambiguation via facets - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet

Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 

Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById


Bad Ideas:
----------
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead
PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!
