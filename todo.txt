
for v1.3

advice



Maybe...?
--------- 
service disambiguation via facets - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet

IocHelper.disableProxies	-> don't like them in IocHelper, want them local to Registry

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices



Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 - it's messy and I don't need it

Registry.createProxy(mixinType, implType)
 - as impl type is not a service

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById



Bad Ideas:
----------
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead
PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!
