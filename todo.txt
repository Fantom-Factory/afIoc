proxies
How to turn them off?
Reg.autobuild should take Bool to make proxes OR have creeateProxy method
autobuild should NOT build proxt by def, 'cos we don't usually make services, but classes.
but then again, it's rare to build an interface... hmmm, maybe consistency is better. 

methods only - or fields
 - don't override virtual or normal methods! Only abstract!
advice

service disambiguation via facets - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet
@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - depPro ctx (a convienience for serviceById)


Re-do DepdendencyCtx to give more detail 
 - See ProviderCtx for details
 

Bad ideas:
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS, use placeholders instead
PerThreadService - is just registry.get()!
