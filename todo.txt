
v1.6.2 Maybe...?
----------------
Delete all deprecated classes -> update BedNap first!

ActorPools... stop / kill all pools on shutdown? No, lets users be in charge of that.
 - shutdown the afIoc actor pool - manually, don't use a shutdown func.

Recursion err with builder methods injection scope 1->2->1
 - THIS PROBABLY WORKS NOW! Just need to write a test for it...
 - can't diagnose this, any reg.serviceById() creates a new InjectionCtx, so I can't detect recursion. 
 - what people do in their builder methods is up to them!

RegistryShutdownHub -> RegistryShutdown
 - what's with that crazy API!?

InjectionCtx.injectionType -> rename, it's not a FantomType!
 - InjectionKind?
 - InjectionMode?



v1.6.4 Maybe...?
----------------
ServiceOverride class that takes a builder method



Meh... can't be arsed
---------------------
MappedConfig  -> MapConfig  ? ConfigMap  ?
orderedConfig -> ListConfig ? ConfigList ?
 - What's the point? The orig names aren't that bad!
 - And *everyone* would need to update their code, even if they were deprecated! 
 
@Inject { optional = true }
 - why would you want to? And what of ctor args? 

service disambiguation via facets 
 - is just another dep pro: map of services keyed by type&facet

@Local (local to the module of the serviceDef in ctx stack) - use case? Annotate method?
 - just a convenience for serviceById



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
---------------------
Allow other @Inject facets
 - so BedSheet can define its own, for fewer pod import statements
 - but if afIoc and afBedSheet are imported at same time ~ conflict!
 
OrderConfig wildcards - e.g. "before: *" NO WILDCARDS
 - use placeholders instead

Create PerThreadService 
 - is just a registry.get()!

IocHelper.eagerLoadBuiltInServices
 - I mean, why?
 
On RegistryShutdown
 - kill ALL ActorPools: 
   - No, lets users be in charge of their own pools.  
 - clean up ALL threads:
   - Can't! Can only clean up up current thread.
