IoC is an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, or Dependency Injection (DI) framework, for the [Fantom](http://fantom.org/) language. 

It is based on the most excellent [Tapestry 5 IoC](http://tapestry.apache.org/ioc.html) for Java. 

See the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/SlimerDude/afioc/wiki/Home) for details.
